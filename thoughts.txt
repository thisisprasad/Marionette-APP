Multiple promises:
	The Promise.all() method returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the promises passed as an iterable have resolved or when the iterable contains no promises. It rejects with the reason of the first promise that rejects. There is no implied ordering in the execution of the array of Promises given. On some computers, they may be executed in parallel, or in some sense concurrently, while on others they may be executed serially. For this reason, there must be no dependency in any Promise on the order of execution of the Promises

Inheritance:
	BaseView = Marionette.ItemView.extend({
		intialize: function () {...}
		
		onRender: function(){
		//	'this' must be associated with the 'instance' here and not specific to 'BaseView'.
			this._getActionConfig();
			this._renderResult();
		}
	});
